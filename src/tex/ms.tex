% Abstract with filler text
\begin{abstract}
    Observations of gravitational waves (GWs) from merging compact binaries have become a regular occurrence. The continued advancement of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration detectors have now produced a catalog of over 90 such mergers, from which we can begin to uncover the formation history of merging compact binaries. In this work, we search for subpopulations in the LVK's third gravitational wave transient catalog (GWTC-3) by incorporating discrete latent variables in the hierarchical Bayesian inference framework to probabilistically assign each BBH observation into separate categories associated with distinctly different population distributions. By incorporating formation channel knowledge within the mass and spin correlations found in each category, we find an over density of mergers with a primary mass of $\sim10\msun$, confidently associated with isolated binary formation. This low-mass subpopulation has a spin magnitude distribution peaking at $a_\mathrm{peak}=$ \result{$\CIPlusMinus{\macros[SpinMag][LowMassPeak][max]}$}, exhibits spins preferentially aligned with the binary's orbital angular momentum, is constrained by \result{$\CIPlusMinus{\macros[NumEvents][LowMassPeak]}$} of our observations, and contributes \result{$\CIPlusMinusPer{\macros[BranchingRatios][LowMassPeak][Percent]}$} to the overall population of BBHs. While we cannot confidently identify the formation history of every event in the catalog, this work is a first step in gaining a deeper understanding of compact binary formation and evolution, and will provide more robust conclusions as the catalog of observations becomes larger.
