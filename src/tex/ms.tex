\begin{abstract}
    Observations of gravitational waves (GWs) from merging compact binaries are becoming a regular occurrence now producing catalogs of over 80 such mergers. Formation of compact binaries with small enough orbital separations such that the energy loss due to gravitational radiation is negligible is a challenging problem in astrophysics. The most common expected formation channels of merging compact binaries fall into two main categories, isolated formation and dynamical assembly. Through characterization of the compact object population, we can begin to determine the prevalence of these two formation categories. Recent studies looking at the population in GWTC-3 have shown that there is a non-negligible contribution due to a dynamical assembly, with large uncertainties. In this work, we look for subpopulations in the catalog by applying discrete latent variables in the hierarchical Bayesian inference framework to probabilistically assign each compact binary observation into separate categories, which have distinctly different population distributions. By incorporating knowledge of the formation channels into of our subpopulation models allows us to infer contributions from each category and get posterior distributions on each observed compact binary's association with each subpopulation. Though looking at the subtle mass-spin correlations between the subpopulations we find the over density of mergers with a primary mass of $\sim10\msun$ is confidently associated with isolated binary formation. This low-mass subpopulation has a spin magnitude distribution peaking at $a_\mathrm{peak}=XX$ while exhibiting spins preferentially aligned with the binary's orbital angular momentum. We find that this subpopulation is constrained by $XX \pm XX$ of our observations, and contributes to $XX\%$ of the overall population of merging compact binaries. This work is a first step in gaining a deeper understanding of compact binary formation and evolution, and will be useful in future studies with larger catalogs of observations.
