\begin{abstract}
    Observations of gravitational waves (GWs) from merging compact binaries have become a regular occurrence with the continued advancement of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration detectors, having produced a catalog of over 80 such mergers. With this now substatial catalog size, we can begin to uncover the formation history of these compact binaries. The two most common expected formation channels of merging compact objects are isolated formation and dynamical assembly, each predicted to produce binaries with unique spin characteristics. Through characterization of the compact object population, we can begin to determine the prevalence of these two formation channels. Recent studies have found a non-neglibile subpopulation formed through dynamical assembly in the GWTC-3 binary black hole (BBH) catalog, though with large uncertainties. In this work, we search for subpopulations in the GWTC-3 catalog by incorporating discrete latent variables in the hierarchical Bayesian inference framework to probabilistically assign each BBH observation into separate categories associated with distinctly different population distributions. Incorporating these discrete variables during inference allows us to easily infer the contributions from each category and the posterior distributions of each BBH's association with each subpopulation. By incorporating our formation channel knowledge with the mass and spin correlations found in each category, we find an over density of mergers of with a primary mass of $\sim10\msun$ is confidently associated with isolated binary formation. This low-mass subpopulation has a spin magnitude distribution peaking at $a_\mathrm{peak}=XX$, while also exhibiting spins preferentially aligned with the binary's orbital angular momentum. We find that this subpopulation is constrained by $XX \pm XX$ of our observations, and contributes to $XX\%$ of the overall population of merging BBHs. This work is a first step in gaining a deeper understanding of compact binary formation and evolution and will be useful in future studies with a larger catalog of observations.
