Spin predictions of binaries formed in the stellar field are dependent on the many physical proccesses that may occur prior to the stellar binary becoming a BBH.  Spin magnitude of a BH can depend largely on the efficiency of angular monentum (AM) transport between it's progenitor stellar core and envelope \citep{2203.02515}. Efficient AM transport, such as through the Taylor-Spruit magnetic dynamo \citep{10.1051/0004-6361:20011465}, leads to low spinning BHs \citep{10.3847/2041-8213/ab339b} while less efficient AM transport, such as that predicted by the shellular model \citep{1992A&A...265..115Z,2012A&A...537A.146E,10.3847/1538-4365/aacb24,2019MNRAS.485.4641C}, can preserve the spin of the pregenitor star. Howver, the effects of AM transport by these mechanisms can be obfuscated by tidal interactions between the binary components, accretion, and mass tranfser, which can spin up the binary or increase AM transport efficiency, thus shedding spin. Natal supernova kicks are thought to be the leading cause of spin orbit misalignments in field binaries, while tidal forces and mass transfer tend to align BH spins with the orbital AM. While we believe the $10\msun$ subpopulation is consistent with the general characteristics associated with field formation, large uncertainites in both spin measurements and predictions from population synthesis models prevent us from placing informative constraints on the formation physics. If the $10\msun$ subpopulation is indeed a product of isolated binary evolution, then our inferred spin distributions hint at this channel producing binaries with low, modestly misaligned spins. This could indicate that AM transport is efficient in massive stars, as modeled by variations of the Taylor-Spruit magnetic dynamo \citep{1706.07053}, and that natal kicks are a common occurence during field BBH formation. Our results are consistent with other analyses that find the data does not require a zero-spin subpopulation \citep{arXiv2205.08574,2301.01312}, though is in tension with other analyses that have claimed its existence \citep{doi.org/10.3847/2041-8213/ac2f3c,2105.10580}; however, we cannot completely rule out zero-spin.

The $35\msun$ peak may also be consistent with field formation, as we infer spin properties consistent to those of the $10\msun$ peak. The sharp fall-off in primary mass of \contA{} in the \comp{} model could give an estimate of the lower edge of the PISN mass gap. The 99th percentile primary mass of \contA{} is $m_{1,99\%} = $ \result{$\CIPlusMinus{\macros[Mass][Composite][ContinuumA][99percentile]}$ \msun}, which is consistent with predictions that place the lower edge of the gap between $40-70\msun$ \citep{1901.00215,2103.07933v1,1910.12874v1,2104.07783v2}. 

\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

As the catalog of compact object mergers continues to grow, we are able to probe the physical properties of these systems with higher fidelity and uncover details in their distributions previously obscured by our lack of data. With these advancements comes the ability to piece together formation histories imprinted in the details of these distributions. Understanding the physical properties of CBC's and their formation has implications for the broader astrophysics community such as providing constraints on stellar evolution theories and population synthesis simulations, the physics of globular clusters, stellar metalicity, neutron star equations of state, and much more. 

By leveraging the hierarchical Bayesian inference toolkit, a mixture of parametric and non-parametric models, and combining information across mass and spin, we were able to identify a peak in the BBH primary mass spectrum at $m_\text{1,peak} = $ \result{$\CIPlusMinus{\macros[Mass][Base][PeakA][max]}$ \msun} that corresponds to a subpopulation of BBH's with low spins and a moderate preference for alignment, consistent with isolated binary formation. We then extended our \base{} to search the rest of the mass spectrum for events with similar spin characteristics to the $10\msun$ subpopulation. We found that the peak in the mass spectrum near $35\msun$ was consistent with the $10\msun$ events. The categorization of the $20\msun$ events remains unclear, since $\sim20\%$ of posterior samples categorized the $20\msun$ peak with the highest mass events. It is also unclear whether the spin tilt distribution of the high mass events is an informed isotropic distribution or just uninformed due to large measurement uncertainty. 

Due to the large uncertainities that are currently present in measurements of BBH properties and population synthesis models, we are unable to place strong constraints on the physics behind isolated binary evolution or (P)PISN. However, if our $10\msun$ and $35\msun$ subpopulations are truly products of these channels, they likely produce binaries with low spins, though the subpopulations being dominated by zeros spin is not ruled out. Aligned spin systems are also not completely ruled out but the subpopulations appear to possess modest misalignments and the apparent fall-off of the $35\msun$ peak may indicate a lower bound on the PISN mass gap of \result{$\CIPlusMinus{\macros[Mass][Composite][ContinuumA][99percentile]}$ \msun}.

The discrete latent variable framework laid out in this analysis and developed in the python library \textsc{GWInferno} can be used to understand the full CBC catalog beyond identifying BBH subpopulations. Currently the LVK categorizes mergers as binary black holes, binary neutron stars, or neutron star binary black holes a-priori based on mass thresholds and tidal deformation values. Instead of categorizing merger components a-priori and then fitting the mass and spin distributions of each category individually, discrete latent variables could be used to simultaneously classify merger components and infer their mass and spin distributions.

% In future work, we would like to incorporate a method for classifying outliers to subpopulations as well as testing this framework on a simulated catalog in order to better understand how uninformed data affects our results. Repeating this analysis on the data from the next observing run, which is expected to increase the catalog size tenfold \jaxen{CITE}, should provide more insightful results with stronger constraints on subpopulation properties.
