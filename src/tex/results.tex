\section{Results} \label{sec:results}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Start by introducing the dataset (GWTC-3) and threshold/cuts on catalog for our dataset
    \item Show results of main run model -- mass dist -- spin dists etc
    \item Discuss more specific details on different subpopulation mass/spin dists
    \item Talk about astrophysical branching ratios of subpopulations and which observations were "put" within each of the subpops
    \item Quantitative statements on spin mag dist of our isolated subpopulation
    \item Quantitative statements on spin orientation dist of our isolated subpop. How much does it prefer aligned spins over the other subpops?
\end{itemize}
